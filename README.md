# CV-Insight-Charts
I produced some info graphic-style charts for my CV - great for visualising your skills in a professional manner.

The charts include:
 - A rating based system out of five, to show the level of confidence in different softwares.
 - An ordered polar bar chart to show progressively my hard skills
 - A word cloud to show my soft skills and personal qualities. Text mining was done from a compiled document of all the feedback I have received. But text can be prepared manually if you wish to specify certain words of course.
